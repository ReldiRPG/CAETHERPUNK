## **Channelers of the Current and Divine Code**

Aetherites—called Grid Clerics, Machine Chaplains, or by the crude Techo-Priest—are conduits for higher powers. Whether they serve machine gods, the Current, aetheric traditions, or corporate deities, they wield awe-inspiring abilities. Some are healers, others are battle-chaplains or tech exorcists. In a world where belief and code blur, their “miracles” might be aetheric rituals, cutting-edge biotech, or networked prayers broadcast from neon-lit cathedrals.

## **Creating a Aetherites

Where does your power come from—a machine deity, the city’s hidden Aether, an ancient aether cult, or a megacorp’s divine grid? What is your creed or protocol? Do you bring hope, justice, control, or disruption to your flock? Are you a true believer, or a master manipulator of symbols and code?
