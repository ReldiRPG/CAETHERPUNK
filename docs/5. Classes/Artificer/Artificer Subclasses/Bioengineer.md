### **3rd Level: Nanite Swarm**

- **Swarm Companion:** You command a swarm of programmable nanites. The swarm can heal, attack, scout, or perform repairs within 30 ft of you. You can shift its function as a bonus action.
- **Mutagenic Infusions:** When you infuse an ally’s equipment, you may also grant them a minor physical upgrade (temporary darkvision, resistance to a damage type, or +1 to an attribute for 1 hour; your choice, once per rest per creature).

### **6th Level: Genetic Hacker**

- When casting a healing program (e.g., _Nanite Patch_), you can choose to grant the target a temporary mutation (e.g., gills for swimming, nightvision, hardened skin for +1 AC) for 10 minutes.

### **14th Level: Viral Adaptation**

- **Self-Modulation:** You can alter your own biology to resist harm. As a reaction, gain resistance to one damage type of your choice until the end of your next turn, or end a condition on yourself (poisoned, stunned, paralyzed, etc.). Usable a number of times equal to your Endurance modifier per long rest.

### **18th Level: Synthetic Apotheosis**

- Your nanite swarm can heal any target within 60 ft to full HP as an action once per long rest. You and allies under the effect of your infusions or swarm gain immunity to disease, poison, and the frightened condition.
