### **3rd Level: Combat Drone**

- **Personal Drone:** You craft a custom drone companion. This drone has a stat block (see below), acts on your initiative, and can attack, scout, deliver infusions, or perform basic tasks. It can be rebuilt for free after a long rest.

### **3rd Level: Combat Engineering**

- **Deployable Turret:** As an action, you can deploy a small turret or field device (e.g., forcefield generator, med-bot). Turrets last for 1 hour or until destroyed. You may have one active at a time; you can infuse it with your programs.

### **6th Level: Overclock**

- As a bonus action, you can overclock your drone, a turret, or a piece of infused equipment, granting it advantage on attack rolls, saving throws, or ability checks for 1 minute. You can do this a number of times equal to your Endurance modifier per long rest.

### **14th Level: Rapid Deployment**

- When you finish a short rest, you can repair or rebuild both your drone and turret without expending materials. You may also instantly deploy both at once as a bonus action once per long rest.

### **18th Level: Master Fabricator**

- You can have up to three deployable devices (turrets/drones) active at once. As a reaction, you can allow a nearby construct or device (within 30 ft) to avoid destruction, causing it to drop to 1 hit point instead.
