### **3rd Level: Sage Protocols**

- **Expanded Program List:** You gain additional programs (spells) that emphasize hacking, detection, and reality alteration—examples: _Detect Grid Anomalies_ (Detect Magic), _Digital Disguise_ (Disguise Self), _Counter-Intrusion_ (Counterspell).
- **Ritual Coder:** You can cast any program marked as a ritual from the Artificer list as a ritual, even if you don’t have it prepared.

### **3rd Level: Aetheric Disruption**

- When a creature you can see within 30 ft casts a spell or uses a tech ability, you can use your reaction and a program slot to attempt to disrupt it (forcing a Logic saving throw vs your program save DC or the effect fails).

### **6th Level: Gridwalk**

- **Aetheric Walk:** As a bonus action, you can phase into the city’s Current or local network, allowing you to teleport up to 30 ft to a spot you can see, provided both spaces are within digital or aetheric “infrastructure” (such as a city block, server farm, subway station, etc.). You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Logic modifier (minimum 1) per long rest.

### **14th Level: Firewall Master**

- **Personal Firewall:** You have advantage on all saving throws against spells, programs, and tech effects.
- **Disruption Field:** Allies within 10 ft of you gain a bonus to saving throws against tech or aetheric effects equal to your Logic modifier (minimum +1).

### **18th Level: Grid Ascendant**

- **Reality Hack:** Once per long rest, you may cast any program you know as if using a 5th-level slot, without expending a slot or components. When you do, you may also choose to alter the program in a minor but significant way (e.g., increase its range, affect an additional target, or create a unique visual effect).
