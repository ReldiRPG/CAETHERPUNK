## **Architects of the Neon Age**

In a world where the lines between science and sorcery are blurred, artificers stand at the cutting edge. They are inventors, hackers, and techno-mages, fusing aetheric energy and bleeding-edge tech into inventions that can alter reality itself. Whether soldering chips, channeling the Current, or coding black-market software, artificers are the innovators on whom the world’s future turns.

## **Creating an Artificer**

When making an artificer, consider your place in the urban sprawl. Are you a freelance drone engineer, a corporate asset, a streetwise hacker, or a rogue magitech prodigy? How did you discover your gift for building wonders? Who taught you—an academy, the streets, or did you teach yourself, trial and error with broken tech and scavenged relics?

## **Class Features**

### **Tech Infusion (Level 1)**

You learn to imbue mundane items with aetheric or digital enhancements. When you finish a long rest, you can touch a number of objects and infuse them, granting special properties (see **Infusions** below). These infusions represent custom coding, nanite injections, or magitech upgrades.

### **Hacker’s Lore (Level 1)**

You gain proficiency with Hacking and Aethertech. If you are already proficient in either, you gain expertise (add double your proficiency bonus).

You can identify aetheric, technological, or digital signatures as a ritual by spending 10 minutes analyzing them.

### **Ritual Programming**

You can upload certain artificer programs (spells) as rituals, representing in-depth coding, hardware assembly, or aetheric attunement.

### **Tool Expertise (Level 2)**

Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses your proficiency with a tool set (such as hacking tools, tinker's kit, or drone tools).

### **Prototype (Level 2)**

You can craft a unique prototype device (choose one: drone, arcane weapon, aetheric analyzer, healing module, etc.). This device’s nature depends on your subclass (see **Specialist Paths**).

### **Specialist Path (Level 3)**

At 3rd level, choose a Artificer Specialty. Each offers a unique suite of powers, programs, and playstyles. Your path grants unique features at 3rd, 6th, 14th, and 18th levels.

- **[Grid Sage](Artificer%20Subclasses/Grid%20Sage.md):** Ritual uploading, code libraries, aetheric device focus.
- **[Engineer](Artificer%20Subclasses/Engineer.md):** Drones, constructs, gadgets.
- **[Bioengineer](Artificer%20Subclasses/Bioengineer.md):** Nanotech, gene-splicing, cybernetic upgrades.

### **Ability Score Improvement (Level 4, 8, 12, 16, 19)**

As per 5E: increase one attribute by 2, or two by 1, or select a feat.

### **Extra Attack (Level 5)**

You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action on your turn.

### **Infusion Mastery (Level 10)**

You can have more infusions active simultaneously, and can reconfigure an infusion during a short rest.

### **Master of the Current (Level 20)**

You become a living conduit for the Current or aetheric code. You can upload one program you know at 1st–3rd level as a bonus action without expending a slot, once per short rest. You have permanent aetheric interface and can swap prepared programs after any rest.
