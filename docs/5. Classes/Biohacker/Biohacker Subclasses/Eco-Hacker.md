## Biohacker Subclass: Eco-Hacker
_You are an eco-hacker, a reclamation shaman, or the city’s wild heart. You wield the primal force of urban nature—plants, rooftop gardens, and invasive vines—and can restore or reclaim city spaces._
**Role:** Urban ecosystem manipulator, infrastructure druid, digital animal master

**You are...**

- A master of the “living city”—its tech, drones, and emergent nature.
- Able to command city systems, repurpose abandoned tech, and tame urban wildlife.
- Your allies are both flesh and circuit: animals, drones, and street spirits.
- The team’s first call when facing environmental threats or needing urban intel.

#### 3rd Level: Urban Command, Digital Tamer

- **Urban Bloom:** Can sense and manipulate the local urban biome. Gain advantage on checks to find resources, safe paths, or hidden sites in the city.
- **Digital Tamer:** May tame, communicate with, and control drones or city animals as if they were beasts. Can “reprogram” a simple drone as a bonus action.

#### 6th Level: Citywide Empathy

- May call upon the entire urban biome for aid—summon flocks of city birds, rats, or clouds of nano-insects. Gain resistance to environmental hazards and digital surveillance.

#### 10th Level: Technobiome Network

- Establish a digital and biological network throughout the city. Once per short rest, can tap into the city’s data streams, sensors, and animal populations for wide-area intelligence. While connected, may induce plant growth or wall of thorns from any plant within the network.

#### 14th Level: City's Heart

- Become a living node of the city itself. You are always aware of major threats, system malfunctions, or environmental changes in your district. Once per long rest, reclaim a city block: all plant/animal life flourishes, structures heal or decay as you choose (lasts 1 hour)
