#### 3rd Level: Nanite Swarm

- When you use Nanite Shift, you may instead become a swarm of nanites (Tiny, can move through cracks, immune to grapple/restraint, attacks deal 1d6 lightning or poison; can’t cast but can use features). You may also command an external swarm to scout, attack, or heal (use owl or bat stats for scouting, wasp swarm for offense).
#### 3rd Level: Programmable Healing

- When you heal with a program, you may give the target temp HP = your Focus mod OR remove one condition (poisoned, blinded, paralyzed, etc.) per rest.

#### 6th Level: Adaptive Immunity

- As a reaction, gain resistance to any one damage type or advantage on a saving throw until your next turn (number of times = Focus mod per long rest).

#### 10th Level: Swarm Evolution

When in Nanite Swarm form, as a bonus action, choose:

- Heal self or ally in swarm (1d8+Focus)
- Shield ally: give resistance to next attack
- Attack: all adjacent enemies take 1d8 lightning or poison (your choice)

#### 14th Level: Urban Evolution

- Shift into swarm form at will (no limit). Once per long rest, you and all allies within 10 ft gain resistance to all damage for 1 round (nanite shield).
