## **Masters of Urban Life, Nanotech, and Aetheric Nature**

Biohackers are street scientists, urban shamans, and nano-mancers who bend the city’s living systems to their will. Some are gene-hackers or rogue biotech engineers, others blend ancient traditions with aetheric science. They manipulate both the wild currents of the city’s ecology and the hidden aether that binds life together—splicing, morphing, and healing with nanites or bio-tech. Whether in a neon-lit jungle or a rooftop garden, a biohacker is always attuned to the pulse of urban nature.

## **Creating a Biohacker**

Where did you learn to bend life? Were you a corporate biologist gone rogue, a member of an eco-hacker collective, or a spiritualist who communes with the city’s spirits and data ghosts? What is your connection to the living city—science, magic, or something stranger?
