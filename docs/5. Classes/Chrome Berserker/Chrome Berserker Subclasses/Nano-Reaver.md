#### 3rd Level: Nano-Rage, Tech Mutation

- **Nano-Rage:** When you rage, nanites course through your veins. Gain temporary HP equal to your Berserker level + END modifier. Choose one random beneficial mutation (see Nano Mutation Table) each time you rage.
- **Tech Mutation:** As a bonus action, morph a limb into a weapon (e.g., blade, bludgeon, shock prod) or a tool (lockpick, scanner, etc.) for 1 minute.

#### 6th Level: Adaptive Rebuild

- End your rage early to heal yourself for 1d12 + Berserker level. Remove a condition (poisoned, stunned, blinded, etc.) when you do.

#### 10th Level: Nano Plague

- Once per long rest, unleash a swarm of hostile nanites in a 30 ft radius. Foes must make END saves or take damage and suffer a random malfunction or mutation (GM discretion).

#### 14th Level: Hive Overload

- Once per long rest, enter a berserk nano-state for 1 minute: resistance to all damage but psychic, and your attacks deal extra nano-damage (1d6 per attack). Enemies hit by you must succeed on a save or be unable to regain HP until end of your next turn.
