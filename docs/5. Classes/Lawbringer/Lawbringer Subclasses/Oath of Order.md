#### 3rd Level: Adaptive Mutation, Bio-Twist

- **Adaptive Mutation:** As a bonus action, you can grant yourself one of the following until your next short rest: climbing speed, swim speed, darkvision, or resistance to one damage type. You may have a number of mutations active at once equal to your FOC modifier (min 1).
- **Bio-Twist:** You can “twist” your biology to survive, gaining advantage on saving throws against poison, disease, and exhaustion. You can extend this benefit to one ally once per long rest.

#### 6th Level: Mutagenic Fortitude

- Gain temporary hit points equal to your Biohacker level + FOC modifier at the start of every combat. These last until depleted or the combat ends.

#### 10th Level: Crisis Metamorph

- As a reaction to taking damage, instantly morph for resistance to that damage type until the start of your next turn. You may do this a number of times equal to your FOC modifier (min 1) per long rest.

#### 14th Level: Hyper-Adaptive Evolution

- Your transformations become instantaneous and unlimited in duration. You may now “stack” two different damage resistances, and you are immune to exhaustion and disease.
