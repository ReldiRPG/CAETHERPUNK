#### 3rd Level: Symbiotic Infusion, Nano Form

- **Symbiotic Infusion:** Your body is suffused with nanites that mend wounds and cure afflictions. When you use your Bio Patch, you may also remove one condition (poisoned, stunned, paralyzed, etc.) from yourself or an ally.
- **Nano Form:** As a bonus action, you can shift your form into a semi-liquid nanite mass. While in this state, you gain resistance to all damage except psychic and can slip through cracks or vents. Lasts up to 1 minute, 1/rest.

#### 6th Level: Adaptive Immunity

- You become immune to diseases and have advantage on saving throws against poison, nanite infections, and environmental hazards. You can grant this resistance to one ally per long rest for 24 hours.

#### 10th Level: Swarm Command

- Command your nanite swarm to perform multiple tasks at once: split to heal multiple allies, disrupt tech, or form a temporary barrier (+2 AC, lasts 1 round, 1/rest).

#### 14th Level: Urban Evolution

- Your symbiotic nanites learn and adapt. Gain resistance to your choice of two damage types (changeable after a long rest). You can communicate silently with all nanite-based creatures or urban biotech systems in the city.
