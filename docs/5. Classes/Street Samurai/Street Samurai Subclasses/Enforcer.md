#### 3rd Level: Urban Command, Digital Tamer

- **Urban Command:** Can sense and manipulate the local urban biome. Gain advantage on checks to find resources, safe paths, or hidden sites in the city.
- **Digital Tamer:** May tame, communicate with, and control drones or city animals as if they were beasts. Can “reprogram” a simple drone as a bonus action.

#### 6th Level: Citywide Empathy

- May call upon the entire urban biome for aid—summon flocks of city birds, rats, or clouds of nano-insects. Gain resistance to environmental hazards and digital surveillance.

#### 10th Level: Technobiome Network

- Establish a digital and biological network throughout the city. Once per long rest, can tap into the city’s data streams, sensors, and animal populations for wide-area intelligence.

#### 14th Level: Urban Overmind

- Become a living node of the city itself. You are always aware of major threats, system malfunctions, or environmental changes in your district. You may command swarms of drones/animals for large-scale effects (at GM discretion).
