## **Masters of Combat and Urban War**

Street Samurai are the city’s elite enforcers, mercenaries, gunfighters, and blade-dancers. They are bodyguards for corporate execs, vigilantes with a code, bounty hunters, or professional soldiers. Whether wielding mono-edge katanas, heavy rail pistols, or cyber-augmented fists, the Street Samurai is a weapon made flesh—refined by discipline, tech, and streetwise grit.

## **Creating a Street Samurai**

What forged your discipline—military training, syndicate service, a dojo on a rooftop, or survival in the city’s underbelly? What is your weapon of choice: ancient steel, bleeding-edge ballistics, or your own nanite-augmented fists? Do you fight for a cause, for a paycheck, or just for survival?
