# Feat: Chrome Brawler

**Prerequisite:** STR 13+

You’ve reinforced your body with cybernetic augmentation or biochrome—your fists are as dangerous as blades.

- Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
    
- You may choose to have your unarmed strikes count as magical for overcoming resistance.
    
- Gain a “chrome arm” upgrade slot (or increase your max chrome slots by 1 if you already have this upgrade).
    
- When grappling, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks.
