Aetheric Disciplines are innate, psychic, or ætheric abilities wielded by the awakened, the engineered, and the truly gifted. These powers bend the physical and mental world, from biotic force and elemental control to psychic assaults and miraculous healing. Operators channel these abilities through sheer will, resonance, or aetheric focus.

- Unleash psychic, biotic, or aetheric power
- Affect the mind, body, or the world around you
- Heal, hinder, or devastate with mental, force, or aetheric might

Each discipline lists its level, power type, short description, and the classes/subclasses with access.
