Digital Programs and Routines are the signature tools of netrunners, aetherites, hackers, AI cultists, and operators who can bend the urban network to their will. Whether called scripts, exploits, system hacks, or AR overlays, routines allow users to:

- Interface with tech, drones, networks, and AI
- Override security, sensors, weapons, and communications
- Heal, harm, or support allies and machines in the digital or hybrid space

Routines may be run via cyberdecks, custom chips, voice command, or direct neural interface. Each program has a level, routine type, a short description, and classes/subclasses with access.
