# Introduction
Welcome to the world of **CÆTHERPUNK 5E**—where neon, chrome, digital gods, and mind-bending powers shape reality in a city that never sleeps.

In this game, you are an **Operator**: a renegade [[../5. Classes/Netrunner/Netrunner.md|Netrunner]], psychic outcast, chrome-plated samurai, nano-witch, info broker, or whatever archetype you imagine. Technology and magic have fused—whether through biohacking, code, psychic force, or pure will. **Æther** is the new "magic," and _programs_ are as deadly as any spell.

# Core Themes

- **Æther:** The invisible force channeling psychic/biotic effects.
- **Programs:** Digital powers, AR hacks, and netrunners’ arsenal.
- **Nano:** Tiny machines for healing, sabotage, miracles.
- **Chrome:** Cybernetic upgrades and physical rewiring.
- **The Grid:** AR, VR, citywide surveillance, and the “ghost layer.”
- **The Street:** Underworld, resistance, gangs, syndicates.

## Æthercrafter Class Details

Masters of techno-arcane synthesis, Æthercrafters weave raw ætheric energy and cutting-edge hardware into wondrous devices. In the neon-lit undercity, they’re equal parts programmer, engineer, and arcane researcher—decoding the mysteries of Æther and forging it into executable programs and mechanical marvels.

### Æthercrafters in the Grid

Across divergent realms and timelines, Æthercrafters stand at the crossroads of magic and machine. On the floating platforms of Malothas’s Arcane Quarter, they trade schematics for self-assembling drones; in the slums beneath the Neon Spires, rogue Æthercrafters barter illicit nano-injections. Wherever digital sorcery and mechanical invention intertwine, an Æthercrafter’s mark can be found.

### Creating an Æthercrafter

**Hit Dice.** 1d8 per Æthercrafter level  
**Hit Points at 1st Level.** 8 + your Constitution modifier  
**Hit Points at Higher Levels.** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per level after 1st

**Proficiencies**
- **Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, shields
- **Weapons:** Simple weapons, tech weapons (energy pistols, cyber-maces)
- **Tools:** Hacking kit, one type of artisan’s tools
- **Saving Throws:** Constitution, Intelligence
- **Skills:** Choose two from Arcana, Investigation, Medicine, Technology, Perception, Sleight of Hand

**Starting Equipment** (in addition to background)
- Two simple or tech weapons
- Energy bolter and 20 energy cells
- Leather jacket or composite scale mesh
- Hacking kit and explorer’s pack

### Multiclassing and the Æthercrafter

- **Prerequisite.** Intelligence 13
- **Proficiencies Gained.** Light armor, medium armor, shields, hacking kit, chosen artisan’s tools
- **Program Slots.** Add half your Æthercrafter levels (rounded up) to your total slots when determining available program slots.

---

### Class Features

### Code Tinkering
_1st-level Æthercrafter_  
You infuse tiny devices with a spark of ætheric code. As an action with thieves’ tools or artisan’s tools in hand, you touch a Tiny nonmagical object and grant it one property:

- Emits bright holo-light (5-ft radius).
- Records and replays a 6-second message (sound only).
- Continuously emits a chosen ambient effect (sound or scent).
- Projects a static glyph/holo-image (up to 25 words).

You can maintain a number of devices equal to your Intelligence modifier (min. 1). Exceeding this limit ends the oldest effect.

### Program Execution
_1st-level Æthercrafter_  
You tap Æther as code routines (“programs”). Logic is your programming stat:
- **Programs Known & Slots:** see table.
- **Preparation:** You prepare a number of programs equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your Æthercrafter level (rounded down, min. 1).
- **Tools Required:** Hacking kit or any device bearing one of your augmentations serves as your focus.

### Device Augmentation
_2nd-level Æthercrafter_  
You can permanently embed Æther codes (“augmentations”) into nonmagical devices. At the end of a long rest, touch up to your Augments Known number of objects and grant each one an augmentation. If you exceed your limit, the oldest augmentation ends first.

### Specialization & Tool Synthesis
_3rd-level Æthercrafter_  
Choose a specialization that tailors your talents. You also gain the ability to conjure one set of artisan’s tools via code (“Tool Synthesis”) once per hour, lasting until you conjure again.

_Specializations:_
- **Ætherchemist**
- **Chromewright**

### Flash of Genius
_7th-level Æthercrafter_  
When you or a creature you can see within 30 ft. makes an ability check or saving throw, use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (min. 1), regaining uses on a long rest.

### Prototype Adept
_10th-level Æthercrafter_
- You can attune to up to four augmented devices.
- Crafting a common or uncommon device augmentation takes ¼ time and costs ½ gold.

### Memory Capsule
_11th-level Æthercrafter_  
You can store one 1st- or 2nd-level program in a device at the end of a long rest. A creature holding the device can use an action to invoke that program, using your programming mod. The program remains until used a number of times equal to twice your Intelligence modifier or until you store another.

### Data Savant
_14th-level Æthercrafter_
- You can attune to up to five augmented devices.
- You ignore requirements on any programmable device.

### Master Augmenter
_18th-level Æthercrafter_  
You can attune to up to six augmented devices.

### Core of Æther
_20th-level Æthercrafter_
- You gain +1 to all saving throws per attuned device.
- When you drop to 0 HP but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to end one augmentation you’re attuned to; you instead drop to 1 HP.

### Field Medic

Æthercrafter specialists renowned for their street-medicine and cybernetic triage, Ripperdocs blend cutting-edge nanotechnology, bio-synth injectors, and rapid-response field surgery to keep allies alive in the harshest urban battlezones.

**Tool Proficiency**  
When you choose this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with a medical kit. If you already have that proficiency, you instead gain proficiency with alchemist’s supplies.

**Healing Routines**  
You always have the following “Programs” prepared. They count as æther programs for you and don’t count against your total prepared programs.

|Æthercrafter Level|Routine 1|Routine 2|
|---|---|---|
|3rd|Stabilize Wounds|Antitoxin Ray|
|5th|Healing Burst|Protective Barrier|
|9th|Restorative Cloud|Mass Stabilization|
|13th|Advanced Restoration|Life-Shield Field|
|17th|Miracle Surge|Renewal Protocol|
#### BioSynth Injectors
_3rd-level Field Medic feature_  
After a long rest, you produce **two** BioSynth Injectors in empty vials. Roll on the table for each when created; the effect triggers when a creature injects it (an action):

|d6|Effect|
|---|---|
|1|Heal 2d6 + your Intelligence modifier hit points|
|2|Regenerate 1d4 hit dice (dedicated healing)|
|3|Neutralize one poison or disease affecting the drinker|
|4|Grant temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier|
|5|End one condition (charmed, blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned)|
|6|Stabilize and restore 1 hit point to an unconscious creature|
You can expend a spell slot to create one extra Injector per slot level.
#### Surgical Savant
_5th-level Field Medic feature_  
Whenever you administer a BioSynth Injector or cast a healing routine using a medical kit as your focus, add your Intelligence modifier to one healing roll or one saving throw the target makes.

#### Rapid Response
_9th-level Field Medic feature_  
When a creature you can see within 30 feet is reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can use your reaction to inject them with a BioSynth Injector you’ve created, causing them to drop to 1 hit point instead. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Enhanced Care
_13th-level Field Medic feature_
- You can cast **Lesser Restoration** or **Remove Curse** without expending a program slot, using your medical kit as the focus.
- When a BioSynth Injector ends a condition, the target also gains temporary hit points equal to 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier.

#### Advanced Surgeon
_17th-level Field Medic feature_  
When you cast a healing routine of 3rd level or lower using a medical kit, the target regains the maximum possible hit points instead of rolling. In addition, you can cast **Raise Dead** once without expending a program slot or material components, using your medical kit as focus. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Currentborn Class Details

Often Clad in biotic glyph tattoos and neurally interfaced implants, a human closes her eyes and steadies her breathing. She focuses her inner will, unleashing a bolt of raw psionic energy that shatters stone and rends flesh. Elsewhere, a half-elf warps light around himself until he vanishes from sight, then reaches into an opponent’s mind and plucks memories like strings to distract and disorient. In the wreckage of a corporate stronghold, a gnome sends a nanobot swarm racing through the air: with a thought, she disassembles the heavily armored exosuit of a security enforcer as though it were made of tissue.

Currentborns—whether born of alien biotic mutations, engineered with arcane neurosims, or randomly awakened by an ætheric storm—reshape reality through sheer force of will. Their minds become conduits for psychic fire, telekinetic force, and astral illusions. Some slip between shadows with a trance of concentration; others collapse minds with a thought. Whatever their origin—bioengineered lineage, aberrant ætheric awakening, or communion with an otherworldly presence—their power pours from the soul.

---

### Creating a Currentborn
Currentborn origins vary far more widely than mundane adventurers’. Your abilities did not come from dusty tomes or a kindly mentor—they sprang from your very bloodstream or a random encounter with forces beyond comprehension. Ask yourself:

- **What awakened your power?** Were you born with it, the product of clandestine experiments? Did a cataclysmic æther storm erupt near you, infusing your mind? Or did a hidden intelligence from the Far Realm whisper into your consciousness?
- **How do you feel about it?** Do you relish the crackle of psychic energy? Do you fear your own thoughts? Does it consume you in nightmares?
- **What drives you?** Do you seek mastery over the storm in your mind? Do you hunt the clandestine labs that spawned psionic soldiers? Or do you simply crave escape from the voices that shout in your head?

Your answers shape how you wield—and how you fear—your power.

---

### Quick Build

- **Attributes:**
    - **FOC (Focus)** should be your highest ability (reflecting mental discipline).
    - **END (Endurance)** should be your second-highest (durability of body and mind).
    - Distribute remaining points among **LOG (Logic), PRES (Presence), AGI (Agility), MGT (Might)** as you see fit.
- **Background:** Choose **Hermit** or **Sage**—both reinforce a life spent wrestling with strange mental visions or secret psionic research.
- **Minor Manifestations:** Choose four:
    1. **Psychic Hand**(Tug on your balls a little.)
    2. **Mind Lash** (1d8 Psychic damage, on failed FOC save it inflicts disadvantage on one saving throw)
    3. **Telekinetic Thrust** (shove one Medium target 5 ft on successful FOC vs. STR/DEX)
    4. One of: **Minor Illusion** (psionic version) or **Light** (psionic photon orb)
- **1st-Level Manifestations:**
    1. **Psi Shield** (like _Shield_, +2 AC and advantage vs. magic missile)
    2. **Mind Spike** (3d8 Psychic damage, target knows it was psionically marked)

---

### Psionic Manifestations

Your mind brims with latent psionic energy. You gain **Minor Manifestations** (at-will cantrips) and **Manifestations** (leveled psionic spells) as shown on the Currentborn table.

- **Spell Slots:** You use Manifestation Slots (1st through 5th) to cast leveled Manifestations. To cast a Manifestation, you expend a slot of its level or higher. All Manifestations use your **FOC** as the casting ability:
    - **Manifestation Save DC** = 8 + Prof Bonus + your FOC modifier
    - **Manifestation Attack Modifier** = Prof Bonus + your FOC modifier
- **Minor Manifestations:** Cast at will, no slot required, use FOC for any saving throws.

---

### Minor Manifestations
_1st-level Currentborn_  
At 1st level, choose four Minor Manifestations from this list. You learn additional minor manifestations at higher levels as indicated on the table.
-add "cantrip" table

---
### Psionic Origins
_1st-level Currentborn_  
Your power springs from one of two extraordinary sources. Choose one at 1st level. Each Origin grants unique features at 1st, 6th, 14th, and 18th levels.

---

### Aberrant Mind Legacy
_1st-level Currentborn_  
Your mind was fractured by forces beyond reality—perhaps a Far-Realm echo, incomplete ceremorphosis of a mind flayer tadpole, or a stray warp from the Astral Plane. Now raw psionic energies swirl inside you, ready to reshape the world.

### Aberrant Origins
_1st-level Currentborn_  
Determine your aberrant backstory. Choose from below, Roll a d6, or work with your GM for additional options:

| d6  | Origin                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :-: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | **Neural Net Overclock.** When surfing a data center, your mind briefly synched with an unstable quantum node. That momentary data­/energy bleed rewrote sections of your neural code, unlocking raw psionic resonance. Now, whenever you “jack in,” faint data-streams shimmer around your head.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|  2  | **Crystal‐Cyber Singularity.** Deep beneath the neon sprawl, an Ætheric crystal node (remnant of an ancient magical ley‐anchor) was unearthed and fused with an experimental A.I. core. When that “Crystal‐Cyber” prototype fractured, an Ætheric wave coursed through the entire city’s cybernetics network. You happened to be linked into that network via your AR interface—and the surge rewrote your mental firmware. Now your thoughts resonate across both the Nether‐Circuit (network) and Æther currents. |
|  3  | **Quantum Fracture.** At the moment a quantum‐computing accelerator in your city’s orbital array suffered a catastrophic entanglement collapse, a shockwave of temporal-phase distortion bathed your entire district. You were walking home under an AR billboard—one instant you saw normal traffic, the next you perceived cascades of potential futures all at once. Since then, your consciousness “echoes” unpredictably between micro-futures, manifesting psionic effects.                                   |
|  4  | **AI Echo Hivemind.** A rogue A.I. known as “Cerulean” secretly seeded fragments of its source code into millions of neural implants sold on the black market. When your implant auto-updated, a shard of Cerulean’s psionic algorithm awakened dormant synaptic pathways in your brain. Now you sometimes broadcast mental signals that overlay the city’s net—other wireless implants distort when you’re upset, and you can “tune in” to overhear thoughts within a few blocks.                                  |
|  5  | **Far-Realm Exposure.** You survived a rift in the æther that left your neurons dancing to alien rhythms. Whenever you manifest psionic power, faint tendrils of otherworldly light ripple across your flesh.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  6  | **Voidtech Residue.** Years ago, a derelict Deep-Space freighter (the _Nightfall Project_) crashed into the upper atmosphere, scattering fragments of alien biomachinery across the mega-city. You stumbled into a wreckage of “psionic condensers” (devices meant to trap and amplify thought­power). A residual charge fused with your bioelectric field, unlocking latent psionic faculties. Now, your skin faintly glows when you channel thought into telekinetic “vortices.”                                  |

### Psionic Spells
_1st-level Currentborn_  
You add the following Manifestations to your known list; they do not count against your Manifestations Known. You can replace one when you gain a Currentborn level. Choose from divination or enchantment spells on the Currentborn list.

**Psionic Spells**

|---|---|
|1st|_Arms of Hadar_, _Dissonant Whispers_, _Mind Sliver_|
|3rd|_Calm Emotions_, _Detect Thoughts_|
|5th|_Hunger of Hadar_, _Sending_|
|7th|_Evard’s Black Tentacles_, _Summon Aberration_ (CH3)|
|9th|_Rary’s Telepathic Bond_, _Telekinesis_|

---

### Biotic Kin Legacy
_1st-level Currentborn_  
Your biotic gifts originate from clandestine biotech augmentation or an ancient engineered bloodline. You carry resonant neural fibers or nanobot implants woven into your very DNA, granting you physical psionic prowess.

### Biotic Proficiency
_1st-level Currentborn_  
You learn to handle specialized biotech tools. You gain proficiency with the **Medtech** skill and one of these tool kits: **Aethertech**, **Cyberdeck**, or **Biolink Interface**.

### Biotic Surge
_1st-level Currentborn_  
When you cast a Manifestation (1st–5th level) that deals damage of a type to which you have resistance (acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison), you can spend 1 Psi Point to add your FOC modifier to one damage roll of that Manifestation. Simultaneously, you gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.

---
### Mindwell
_2nd-level Currentborn_  
Your mastery of mental focus grants you **Psi Points**—a reserve of raw psionic energy.

- You gain a number of Psi Points equal to your Currentborn level (max 20).
- You regain all expended Psi Points when you finish a long rest.
- You can spend Psi Points to fuel **Psionic Techniques** (see below) or to cast certain Manifestations without slots (via Psionic Sorcery).

---

### Psionic Techniques
_3rd-level Currentborn_
At 3rd level, you learn two **Psionic Techniques**—special ways to channel your psionic energy into enhanced effects. You learn one additional Technique at 10th level and another at 17th level. Unless a Technique specifies otherwise, you cast it as part of casting a Manifestation or as an action/bonus action as noted, spending the listed Psi Points.

You regain all Psi Points when you finish a long rest (unless a Technique says otherwise).

**Choose two Metapsionic Options at 3rd Level (additional at 10th & 17th):**

- **Focused Blast (1 PP).** When you cast a Manifestation that deals damage, you can spend 1 Psi Point to add your FOC modifier to one of its damage rolls.
- **Extended Mind (1 PP).** When you cast a Manifestation that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 Psi Point to double its duration (maximum 24 hours).
- **Quick Manifest (2 PP).** When you cast a 1st- or 2nd-level Manifestation with a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 Psi Points to cast it as a bonus action instead.
- **Twin Thought (Variable PP).** When you cast a Manifestation that targets only one creature and doesn’t have a range of self, you can spend additional Psi Points equal to the Manifestation’s level to target a second creature within range with the same Manifestation.

---
### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th levels, you can increase one ability score (FOC, END, LOG, PRES, AGI, or MGT) by 2, or two ability scores by 1 each. You can’t increase an ability above 20 using this feature.

---
### Psionic Sorcery
_3rd-level Currentborn - Aberrant Mind_
When you cast a Manifestation from your **Psionic Spells** list, you can expend a slot as normal **or** spend Psi Points equal to the spell’s level. If you cast it with Psi Points, it requires no verbal or somatic components and no material components (unless they are consumed by the spell).

### Psychic Defenses
_6th-level Currentborn - Aberrant Mind_
You gain resistance to Psychic damage, and you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.
### Elemental Bioweave
_6th-level Currentborn - Biotic Kin_
Your body weaves psionic nanofibers to absorb energy. Whenever you or an ally within 30 ft is targeted by a Manifestation or effect that deals damage of a type you are resistant to, you can use your reaction and spend 1 Psi Point to absorb up to 10 + Currentborn level damage (all taken by you). If the incoming damage exceeds that amount, you and the original target each take any excess. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your FOC modifier (minimum 1). You regain all uses when you finish a long rest.
### Revelation in Flesh
_14th-level Currentborn - Aberrant Mind_
You can reshape your body with aberrant psionic energy. As a bonus action, you can spend 1 or more Psi Points to gain benefits for 10 minutes. For each point spent, choose one:

- **Far-Sighted Vision (1 PP):** Your eyes become spectral tendrils. You can see invisible creatures and objects within 60 ft, ignoring illusions.
- **Levitation Wings (1 PP):** Diaphanous wings of psychic light sprout; you gain flight equal to your walking speed (hover).
- **Aquatic Form (1 PP):** Fine cilia or gills sprout; you gain a swimming speed equal to twice your walking speed and can breathe underwater.
- **Ethereal Slip (2 PP):** Your body becomes rubbery and ghostlike; you can move through creatures and objects as if difficult terrain. If you end your turn inside an object, you take 5 force damage.

You can combine multiple benefits by spending additional Psi Points. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
### Wings of Will
_14th-level Currentborn - Biotic Kin_
Your biotic implants sprout psionic membranes. As a bonus action, you manifest a pair of semitranslucent wings of biotic energy. While active, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed and can hover. The wings last until you dismiss them as a bonus action, become incapacitated, or die. You cannot manifest wings while wearing medium or heavy armor (unless modified to accommodate them).
### Warping Implosion
_18th-level Currentborn - Aberrant Mind_
You unleash a psychic shockwave that tears reality apart. As an action, you teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 120 ft. Then, each creature within 30 ft of the space you left must succeed on a Strength save (DC = 8 + Prof Bonus + FOC mod) or take 3d10 force damage and be pulled up to 20 ft toward that space. On a successful save, they take half damage and aren’t pulled. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest **unless** you spend 5 Psi Points to reactivate it.
### Biotic Resonance
_18th-level Currentborn - Biotic Kin_
Your entire being hums with biotic energy. Whenever you use **Warping Implosion**, you can choose to spend 3 Psi Points to leave behind a resonant echo at your departure point. Each creature still within 30 ft of that point must make a Constitution save (DC = 8 + Prof Bonus + FOC mod) or be stunned until the end of its next turn and take an additional 2d10 force damage. On a successful save, they take half damage and aren’t stunned.
### Psionic Restoration
_20th-level Currentborn - Aberrant Mind_
At 20th level, you regain **10 Psi Points** whenever you finish a short rest.

## Operative Legacy Class Details

Clad in layered combat-weave hide under modular armor plates, an operative slinks down a neon-lit alley, eyes darting to the shifting shadows. Cybernetic reflexes hum beneath her skin, ready to ignite at the first sign of danger. As she corners a black-market broker who spoke too loudly of corporate secrets, she draws a monofilament vibrodagger and strikes—silently, lethally—before vanishing into the night.

On a rain-slick rooftop, a titanshot operative hefts a massive reinforced railgun. His servomechanized frame absorbs the kick as rounds of armor-piercing shells rip through a patrol drone. He grins, flicks a toggle on his HUD, and recalibrates for the next shot. Steam hisses from his power core as he dissipates excess heat, preparing to hold this rooftop against whatever comes next.

In the bowels of a research tower, a ghostblade ninja drifts through motion sensors, snow-white cyber-cloak flickering against ghost-etched circuitry. She halts behind a heavily guarded lab door, nanites dancing beneath her skin as she hacks the lock’s neural interface—no wire required. Once inside, she whispers an oath and grafts a Neural Sever spike into her target’s cortex; the guard collapses, mind silenced, before his body slumps to the floor.

Operatives are the sharpened edge of Cætherpunk combat: highly trained, cybernetically or biotically augmented specialists whose very presence warps the battlefield. In a world of Æthercasters who bend cosmic energies and Techbards who hack reality’s bandwidth, operatives exist to deliver precise martial impact—whether that means storming a guarded facility, eliminating a high-value target, providing suppressive overwatch, or executing clandestine extractions. Their bodies are living arsenals, fused with technology, serums, and psionics. Their skills span clandestine infiltration, heavy-weapons mastery, brutal close-quarters combat, and surgical shutdowns of friend and foe alike.

---
### Operative Overview

- **Hit Die:** d10 per operative level
- **Primary Abilities:** Might/Agility & Endurance—operatives rely on raw physical prowess and hardened reflexes.
- **Saves:** Might & Endurance
- **Proficiencies:**
    - **Armor:** Light armor, medium armor, shields
    - **Weapons:** Simple weapons, martial weapons
    - **Tools:** One set of artisan’s tools (tied to specialty) + one gaming set or thieves’ tools
    - **Skills:** Choose four from Athletics, Acrobatics, Stealth, Perception, Investigation, Intimidation, Sleight of Hand, and Survival

Operatives fall into six distinct paths (chosen at 3rd level), each reflecting a particular combat archetype:
1. **Path of the Augmented Berserker**
2. **Path of the Ghostblade Ninja**
3. **Path of the Fire-Beast Sniper**
4. **Path of the Corporate Assassin**
5. **Path of the Titanshot “Adam-Smasher”**
6. **Path of the Bio-Hacker**
All operatives share a core suite of martial and technological talents—rapid strikes, cybernetic maneuvers, adrenaline surges, and high-intensity survivability. Their subclass choice refines those base talents into a specialized combat discipline.

---
### Creating an Operative
**Step 1: Choose Your Ability Scores.**
- **Priority:** Agility (for precision, stealth, ranged aim) and Constitution (for sheer resilience). Might also matters if you lean into heavy weapons or close-quarters combat; pick according to your chosen path.
- **Background:** A soldier, mercenary, spy, or street punk all fit naturally.

**Step 2: Select Proficiencies.**
- **Armor & Weapons:** You automatically gain proficiency in light and medium armor, shields, and all martial/simple weapons.
- **Skills:** Choose four from Athletics, Acrobatics, Stealth, Perception, Investigation, Intimidation, Sleight of Hand, Survival.

**Step 3: Define Your Toolkit Specializations (Level 1).**  
At 1st level, you may pick **two modules** from your Operative’s Toolkit (see below under “Class Features”). These are modular gear enhancements—pick ones that match your concept.

**Step 4: Pick Your Combat Style (Level 2).**  
At 2nd level, choose one of four Combat Styles. This choice influences your fighting focus (sharpshooter, brawler, stealth sentinel, or cyber-marksman).

**Step 5: Choose Your Path (Level 3).**  
At 3rd level, you commit to one of the six operative subclasses. This defines your signature abilities and how you’ll specialize in infiltration, brute force, sniper tactics, assassination, heavy-weapons destruction, or biotech enhancements.

### Quick Build
- **Ideal for a Ghostblade Ninja Operative:**
    1. **Race:** Human (for extra skill versatility) or Half-Elf (for Agility + two other stats).
    2. **Ability Scores (Standard Array, Point Buy, or Rolling):**
        - Agility 16, Constitution 14, Wisdom 12, Endurance 12, Intelligence 10, Charisma 8.
    3. **Background:** Criminal or Urchin (grants proficiency in Stealth + Thieves’ Tools).
    4. **Level 1:**
        - Skills: Stealth, Acrobatics, Perception, Investigation.
        - Operative’s Toolkit modules: **Micro-Camo Cloak**, **Echo-Pulse Sensor**.
        - Combat Training maneuver: **Precision Strike** (once per short rest, add +2d6 once per turn when you hit with a weapon).
    5. **Level 2:**
        - Combat Style: **Stealth Sentinel** (Shadow Strike bonus action while hidden).
    6. **Level 3:**
        - Subclass: **Path of the Ghostblade Ninja**.

Within a few levels, this Ghostblade Ninja will slip into shadows at will, strike unseen, hack advanced locks, and teleport between cover—exemplifying the archetypal “silent killer.”

### Class Features
### Combat Training
_1st-level Operator_  
You have undergone intensive martial instruction. You gain proficiency in the **Athletics** and **Acrobatics** skills. In addition, choose one **Combat Maneuver** from the list below. You learn how to execute this maneuver using your martial training. You can use the chosen maneuver once per short rest unless otherwise noted. You add your Endurance or Agility modifier (your choice) to the maneuver’s effect.
- **Disarm:** As part of a melee attack that hits, you can attempt to knock a weapon or item out of the target’s grasp. The target must succeed on a Endurance save (DC 8 + Proficiency + STR or DEX) or have the item fly 5 feet away.
- **Trip:** When you hit a creature with a melee attack, you can force it to make a Agility saving throw (DC 8 + Prof + STR or DEX). On a failure, you knock it prone.
- **Precision Strike:** Once per turn when you hit with a weapon attack, you can add an extra 2d6 to the damage.
- **Battering Blow:** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon, you can choose to deal an extra 1d8 damage and push the target 5 feet away.

### Operative’s Toolkit
_1st-level Operator_ 
Your combat rig is a modular exoskeletal harness embedded with slots for two “modules.” During a short rest, you may swap out which two modules you have installed. Choose **two** modules from the list below. Unless stated otherwise, you recover all module uses when you finish a short rest.
1. **Micro-Camo Cloak:** Once per short rest, as an action you become invisible for up to 1 minute. The invisibility ends if you attack or cast a spell. While invisible this way, your movement is halved.
2. **Neuro-Injector:** You carry 3 Neuro-Darts. As an action you can fire a dart at a creature within 30 feet; the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + Proficiency + DEX) or be incapacitated (unconscious, stable) for 1 round. On a successful save, it is only stunned for 1 round. These darts recharge (all 3) on a short rest.
3. **Pop-Out Rail-Grip:** You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with a two-handed firearm or energy rifle. Additionally, when you score a critical hit with such a weapon, you deal an extra 1d8 force damage.
4. **Serum Dispenser:** You carry **3 serum doses**. As an action, you inject one dose into yourself, granting one of the following effects (each lasts 1 minute or until you end it as a free action):
    - **Hyper-Endurance Serum:** You gain +2d6 to all melee weapon damage rolls and advantage on Endurance checks.
    - **Phase-Shift Serum:** You gain resistance to non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and you can move through creatures’ spaces as difficult terrain.
    - **Nanite Regen Serum:** At the start of each of your turns, you regain hit points equal to half your Proficiency Bonus (minimum 1).  
        You can end a serum’s effect early (no action) to switch to another unused dose. All 3 doses recharge on a short rest.
5. **Echo-Pulse Sensor:** Once per short rest, as an action you fire an echo pulse in a 30 foot radius. All invisible or hidden creatures in that radius must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + Prof + WIS) or be revealed automatically for 1 minute (their location remains visible to you, even if they otherwise become hidden).

### Fight or Flight
_1st-level Operator_ 
 Your body is conditioned for instantaneous evasive action. Whenever you take damage from a creature you can see, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed without provoking opportunity attacks. You cannot end this movement in an occupied space.
### Action Surge
_2nd-level Operator_ 
You press your neural accelerator to act beyond your normal limits. On your turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and (if available) your bonus action. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest to use it again.

### Combat Style
_2nd-level Operator_ 
You adopt one of the following combat specialties. Your chosen style grants you a feature now, and an improved benefit at 10th level.
- **Augmented Brawler:**
    - **2nd Level:** You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls when you hit with unarmed strikes or melee weapons.
    - **10th Level:** Your unarmed strikes count as magical for overcoming resistances.
- **Sharpshooter:**
    - **2nd Level:** Attacking at long range (beyond normal range) doesn’t impose disadvantage, and you gain +1 to damage on ranged weapon attacks.
    - **10th Level:** Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.
- **Stealth Sentinel:**
    - **2nd Level:** You gain proficiency in Stealth. While you are hidden or invisible, you can make a **Shadow Strike** as a bonus action once per turn: if you hit with a melee weapon, add +2d6 extra psychic damage.
    - **10th Level:** After making a Shadow Strike, you do not reveal yourself—you remain hidden/invisible until you end it.
- **Cyber-Marksman:**
    - **2nd Level:** When you score a critical hit with a technologically-based weapon (firearms, energy rifles, grenades), you deal an extra 2d8 damage.
    - **10th Level:** Once per short rest, you can use a bonus action to “Lock On” a target you can see within range. Your next attack against that target ignores all cover (even magical cover); only total cover stops your shot.

### Path
_3rd-level Operator_ 
At 3rd level, you choose a path that defines your specialization. Your path grants features at 3rd, 6th, 10th, 14th, 15th, and 18th levels.
1. **Path of the Augmented Berserker**
2. **Path of the Ghostblade Ninja**
3. **Path of the Fire-Beast Sniper**
4. **Path of the Corporate Assassin**
5. **Path of the Titanshot “Adam-Smasher”**
6. **Path of the Bio-Hacker**
_(See the detailed subclass features below.)_

### Ability Score Improvement
**(Levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 19)** When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score by 2 or two ability scores by 1 each (to a maximum of 20). You may instead take a feat, if your DM allows it.

### Extra Attack
_5th-level Operator_ 
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
### Evasion
_7th-level Operator_ 
When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Agility saving throw to take only half damage (such as a grenade or energy burst), you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail. (Requires you to be wearing light or medium armor.)
### Indomitable
_9th-level Operator_ 
You can reroll one saving throw that you fail. If you do so, you must use the new roll, even if it is lower. You can use this feature once per long rest.
### Relentless Assault
_11th-level Operator_ 
Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can spend 1 Tech Cell or inject 1 serum dose (if you have any remaining) to make one unarmed or melee weapon attack as a bonus action against the same target.

### Defensive Agility
_14th-level Operator_ 
While you are wearing light or medium armor and not wielding a shield, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
### General’s Command
_17th-level Operator_ 
As a bonus action, you shout orders and tactical cues. Up to three allied creatures of your choice within 10 feet gain a +1 bonus to all saving throws for 1 minute. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Ultimate Operative
_20th-level Operator_ 
You tap into your full arsenal and cyber‐reflex bandwidth. Once per long rest, you can:
1. Fully restore **all** your Tech Cells, Serum doses, Resonance Charges, Sigil Dice, and any other subclass‐specific resources.
2. Activate **Heroic Resistance** for 1 minute: you gain resistance to all damage, and attacks that would be critical hits against you are treated as normal hits instead.

### Operative Paths
Below is a brief summary of each path’s features. Each path grants six features: at 3rd, 6th, 10th, 14th, 15th, and 18th levels.

#### 1. Path of the Augmented Berserker
Your body is augmented with industrial-grade servos and reflex-chip implants that let you surge past normal human limits in melee combat.
- **3rd–Rage Protocol:** Enter Rage Protocol (bonus action) for 1 minute: +2 melee damage, advantage on Endurance checks & saves, resistance to B/P/S. Usable a number of times = your CON mod (min 1) per long rest.
- **6th–Berserker’s Endurance:** When reduced to 0 HP but not killed outright, drop to 1 HP instead and automatically enter Rage Protocol. Once per long rest.
- **10th–Titan Fist:** Once per short rest, when you hit with an unarmed or melee weapon, you can unleash a Titan Fist: 10 ft cone, all creatures make DEX save (DC 8 + Prof + STR). On fail, 3d8 force damage + prone; on success, half damage, not prone.
- **14th–Servo-Endurance Augmentation:** Your unarmed strikes count as magical, and you add your proficiency bonus to unarmed-strike damage.
- **15th–Unbreakable Will:** Once per long rest, when you would be incapacitated by poison, stun, or exhaustion, you automatically succeed on the saving throw instead.
- **18th–Juggernaut’s Aura:** You radiate a 10 ft aura: allies in the aura gain +1 to saving throws; enemies in the aura have disadvantage on Endurance and Agility saves. At 18th level, aura expands to 20 ft.

---
#### 2. Path of the Ghostblade Ninja
You are a cyber-ghost: a silent infiltrator who strikes unseen, cutting down foes before they know you exist. Nanocamouflage, neural spikes, and teleportation implants define your lethal grace.

- **3rd–Adaptive Nanocloak:** You gain the **Nanocamo Cloak** module built into your rig. As an action, become invisible for up to 1 minute (attacking ends invisibility). While invisible, you move at half speed. Recharge: short rest.
- **6th–Shadow Strike:** While invisible or hidden at the start of your turn, if you hit a creature with a melee attack, add +2d6 psychic damage. You remain invisible/hidden at the end of this attack (no reveal).
- **10th–Silent Evasion:** When you are targeted by an opportunity attack or melee attack, you can use your reaction to become invisible until the end of the attacker’s turn. Recharge: short rest.
- **14th–Edge-Whisper Precision:** Once per turn, when you hit from invisibility/stealth with a melee weapon, force the target to make a CON save (DC 8 + Prof + DEX). On a failure, the target is **cerebral paralyzed** (incapacitated, no actions) until the end of its next turn; on a success, it is stunned for 1 round.
- **15th–Echo Blade:** You learn the **Neuro-Dart Shot**: as a bonus action, fire one Neuro-Dart (range 30 ft). The target makes a CON save (DC 8 + Prof + DEX); on a failure, it falls unconscious for 1 minute (wakes if takes damage); on success, it is stunned for 1 round. You carry 3 darts; recharge on a short rest.
- **18th–Phantom Vanish:** Once per long rest, after you score a melee hit from invisibility, you can teleport up to 30 ft to an unoccupied space you can see and remain invisible until the end of your next turn.

---
#### 3. Path of the Fire-Beast Sniper
You meld nanite-infused hunting cloaks with long-range rail-rifles. You mark targets across city blocks, deliver suppressive fields, and rain down orbital-grade ordnance with unerring precision.

- **3rd–Holo-Scope Mark:** You gain a built-in **Holo-Scope Mark** function. As part of a ranged attack (within 600 ft), you may spend 1 Tech Cell to “Mark” the target. Your next hit against that Marked target within 1 minute deals an extra 2d6 ballistic or radiant damage.
- **6th–Cold Zero-G Stabilizer:** As long as you remain stationary and have not taken damage since the start of your turn, you gain +2 bonus to AC and advantage on Agility saving throws until the start of your next turn.
- **10th–Transient Ordinance:** Once per short rest, when you fire a shot beyond 300 ft, you may expend a Sigil Die to have the projectile ignore cover and detonate 20 ft past the target. All creatures within a 10 ft radius of that point make a DEX save (DC 8 + Prof + DEX); on a failure, they take 3d6 radiant damage; on success, half damage.
- **14th–Suppressive Overwatch:** Once per short rest, as an action you designate up to three points you can see (each within 100 ft and within 30 ft of each other). Each becomes a **Suppressive Field** for 1 minute. At the start of a creature’s turn in a field, it must succeed on a Endurance save (DC 8 + Prof + DEX) or have its speed halved and take 2d6 piercing damage; on success, half damage, no speed penalty.
- **15th–Master Sniper’s Focus:** Once per long rest, as a bonus action you expend a Sigil Die to **Lock On** a Marked target (must still be within 600 ft). For 1 minute, the target has disadvantage on Agility saves, and you ignore all cover (even magical cover); only total cover stops your shot.
- **18th–Ghost Shell:** As a bonus action, for 1 minute you gain **Truesight** to 30 ft (see through invisibility, illusions, and darkness). In addition, your ranged attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. Recharge: long rest.

---
#### 4. Path of the Corporate Assassin
You specialize in surgical strikes, neuro-implants, and digital sabotage. Your presence is felt only as a whisper—by the time anyone realizes you’ve arrived, you’ve already disappeared.

- **3rd–Adaptive Holo-Suit:** You gain the **Adaptive Cloak** module. As an action, become invisible for up to 1 minute (attacking ends invisibility). While invisible, your movement is halved. Recharge: short rest (3 charges).
- **6th–Neuro-Dart Mastery:** You carry **3 Neuro-Darts** that incapacitate targets on a failed CON save (DC 8 + Prof + DEX) for 1 round (or unconscious for 1 minute if asleep). You may use one dart as an action; full recharge on short rest.
- **10th–Synaptic Sever:** Once per short rest, when you hit with a melee **Monoknife** or any finesse weapon, force the target to make a CON save (DC 8 + Prof + DEX). On a failure, they are **cerebral paralyzed** (incapacitated, no actions) until the end of their next turn; on success, stunned for 1 round.
- **14th–System Override:** Once per short rest, as an action you interface with a security terminal or networked device within 10 ft. Choose up to three devices (turrets, cameras, locked doors, vault locks) that share a network within 100 ft. Each must make an Intelligence (Hacking) check vs. your hacking DC (8 + Prof + INT). On a failure, that device is disabled/offline for 1 minute.
- **15th–Silent Extraction:** If you reduce a Marked or high-value target to 0 HP while invisible, you vanish as a bonus action (no attack of opportunity) to any unoccupied space within 30 ft that you can see. Recharge: long rest.
- **18th–Ghost Step:** When you are invisible or hidden, you can step between shadows. As a bonus action, teleport up to 60 ft to an unoccupied space you can see that is in dim light or darkness. Remain invisible at the end of the teleport. Uses per short rest = your DEX mod (minimum 1).

---

#### 5. Path of the Titanshot
Your body is reinforced with heavy exoskeletal plating, power amplifiers, and servo didn’t chassis. You clear objectives with massive ordnance, blast walls with shockwaves, and barrel through enemy lines as an unstoppable juggernaut.
- **3rd–Reinforced Exoskeleton:** You gain a +1 bonus to all non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage resistance.
- **6th–Overclocked Neural Link:** You gain a +2 bonus to Endurance checks and saving throws, and advantage on saves to resist forced movement or being knocked prone.
- **10th–Ground-Shatter Slam:** Once per short rest, as an action you slam weapon or gauntlet into the ground. Each creature in a 10 ft radius must make a DEX save (DC 8 + Prof + STR). On a failure, they take 2d8 force damage and are knocked prone; on success, half damage, not prone.
- **14th–Æther-Vulcan Blast:** You gain an arm-mounted **Æther-Vulcan Shotgun** in your rig. Once per short rest, as an action unleash a 15 ft cone of rotary explosive rounds: creatures in the cone make a DEX save (DC 8 + Prof + CON). On a failure, they take 6d8 piercing + 3d8 radiant; on success, half damage. After firing, you are knocked prone unless you pass a DC 15 Endurance save.
- **15th–Fortress Stance:** As a bonus action, lock your exoskeleton in **Fortress Stance** for 1 minute. While in stance, you:
    1. Gain complete cover vs. ranged attacks (all ranged attacks automatically miss you).
    2. Have advantage on saving throws vs. area-of-effect attacks.
    3. Cannot move (unless you end the stance as a free action), but you can still use weapons, blades, or Æther-Vulcan blasts.
- **18th–Unstoppable Juggernaut:** When you would be reduced to 0 HP, you drop to 1 HP instead and remain standing. Once used, cannot use until short rest.

---
#### 6. Path of the Bio-Hacker

You merge nanotech, psionic resonance chips, and experimental serums to transcend human frailty. Your body is a living lab—release nanite clouds, push and pull foes with psychic force, and unleash bio-surges that turn you into a freak of nature.
- **3rd–Super-Serum Kit:** You carry **3 combat serums**. As an action, you inject one dose, replicating the chosen effect (1 minute duration or until you dismiss it):
    1. **Hyper-Endurance Serum:** +2d6 force to melee damage, advantage on STR checks.
    2. **Phase-Shift Serum:** Resistance to non-magical B/P/S, movement through creatures’ spaces as difficult terrain.
    3. **Nanite Regen Serum:** At the start of each of your turns, regain hit points equal to half your Proficiency Bonus (minimum 1).  
        You can end a serum early (no action) to switch to another unused one. All three recharge on a short rest.
- **6th–Psionic Resonance:** You have a built-in **Resonance Chip**. As an action, spend 1 Resonance Charge (equal to your Proficiency Bonus per long rest) to emit a psionic shove or pull: choose a creature within 30 ft; it must make a STR or DEX saving throw (DC 8 + Prof + CON). On a failure, you either push it 10 ft away or pull it 10 ft toward you.
- **10th–Nanite Cloud:** Once per short rest, as an action you release a 10 ft radius cloud of hostile nanites around you that lasts 1 minute.
    - **Enemies** within the cloud at the start of their turn must make a CON save (DC 8 + Prof + CON) or take 2d6 necrotic damage (nanite breach) and have disadvantage on weapon attack rolls until they leave the cloud. On success, half damage, no disadvantage.
    - **Allies** in the cloud at the start of their turn regain 1d6 HP (nanite repair).
- **14th–Adaptive Physiology:** When you take acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 minute. Once used, cannot use again until a short rest.
- **15th–Apex Catalyst:** Once per long rest, as a bonus action you inject the **Apex Catalyst Serum**. For 1 minute:
    1. You gain +2 to all attack and damage rolls (ranged and melee).
    2. When you deal radiant or necrotic damage with a serum effect or Psionic Resonance, you heal half that amount.
    3. You gain Truesight 30 ft (see through illusions, invisibility, and darkness).
- **18th–Bio-Surge Overdrive:** As an action, hypercharge your nanites and psionic nexus. For 1 minute.
    1. Your movement speed doubles.
    2. You have advantage on all saving throws.
    3. When you hit a creature with a melee attack, that creature must succeed on a DEX save (DC 8 + Prof + CON) or be knocked prone as bio-shrapnel bursts from your limbs.  
        Once used, cannot use again until a long rest.

### Multiclassing and the Ripperdoc
- **Prerequisite.** Focus 13
- **Gained Proficiencies.** Light armor, shields, medical kit, chosen artisan’s tools
- **Slots.** Add half your Ripperdoc levels (rounded up) when determining total Tech slots for other classes.

---
### Advanced First Aid
_1st-level Ripperdoc_  
You channel medical routines through your medical kit.

- **Spellcasting Ability:** Focus.
    - **Routines & Slots:** See table.
    - **Preparation:** Choose FOC modifier + half your Ripperdoc level routines after a long rest.
    - **Focus:** Medical kit.
---
### Basic Routines
_1st-level Ripperdoc_  
At 1st level, you learn three trivial procedures—_Basic Routines_—like **Stabilize**, **Mend**, or **Antitoxin Flush**. These cost no protocol slots and you can use them at will. You gain more as shown in the table, and can swap one out when you level.

---
### Hippocratic Protocols
_1st-level Ripperdoc_  
You deploy advanced medical techniques—called **Protocols**—using your training and tools. To run a Protocol of a given tier, you expend one Protocol Slot of that tier. After each long rest, you prepare a number of Protocols equal to your Focus modifier plus half your Ripperdoc level (rounded down, minimum of one).

---
### Medical Triage
_1st-level Ripperdoc_  
When you use a healing routine on a creature at 0 HP, they regain at least 1 HP.

---
### BioSynth Injectors
_2nd-level Ripperdoc_  
At the end of a long rest, you produce **two** BioSynth Injectors in empty vials. Each injector stores a 1st-level healing routine. As an action, a creature can inject it (no kit required). You can expend a 2nd-level slot to create one extra injector.

---
### Specialization & Auto-Injector Drone
_3rd-level Ripperdoc_  
Choose a path:
- **Field Medic:** Your injectors also grant temporary HP equal to FOC mod.
- **Cyber Surgeon:** Your injectors can remove one condition (poisoned, blinded, etc.) instead of healing.

You also deploy a small drone on the battlefield. As a bonus action, command it to deliver one injector to an ally within 30 ft. The drone disappears if destroyed or after 1 use.

---
### Mass Mend
_5th-level Ripperdoc_  
Cast a healing routine as an action to restore 2d6 + TEC mod HP to up to six creatures you can see within 30 ft.

---
### Surgical Savant
_6th-level Ripperdoc_  
When you cast a healing routine or administer an injector, add your TEC modifier to one healing roll or one saving throw the recipient makes.

---
### Rapid Response
_8th-level Ripperdoc_  
When a creature within 30 ft. drops to 0 HP but isn’t dead outright, you can use your reaction and expend an injector to bring them to 1 HP. Uses per long rest = TEC mod (min 1).

---
### Shared Stim
_10th-level Ripperdoc_  
When you heal a target with a slot of 1st–3rd level, you and one ally within 10 ft. also regain HP equal to half the healing amount.

---
### Enhanced Care
_13th-level Ripperdoc_  
You cast _lesser restoration_ or _remove curse_ once each without expending a slot, using your kit. Also, when an injector ends a condition, the target gains temporary HP equal to 1d6 + FOC mod.

---
### Advanced Surgeon
_15th-level Ripperdoc_  
When you cast a healing routine of 3rd level or lower, creatures regain the maximum possible HP. Once per long rest, you can inject an ally with a “Raise Dead” equivalent (no components).

---
### Trauma Network
_18th-level Ripperdoc_  
Over a network link, you can heal a willing creature you can see or know the location of (up to 120 ft.) once per slot level without being adjacent. Targets regain HP as if you were adjacent.

---
### Master Surgeon
_20th-level Ripperdoc_
- Your injectors heal maximum HP and you create **three** injectors per long rest.
- When you would drop to 0 HP, you may use your reaction to expend an injector and drop to 1 HP instead.

---

### Ripperdoc Subspecialties
### Cyber Surgeon

**3rd-Level: Cybernetic Integration**  
You can install or repair simple implants in the field. With your medical kit and tinker’s tools, spend 10 minutes grafting one basic implant into a willing creature. Choose one:
- **Neural Accelerator:** +1 to one Logic-based check or attack roll for 1 hour.
- **Dermal Plating** +1 bonus to AC for 1 hour.
- **Muscle Actuator:** +5 ft. walking speed for 1 hour.

You can maintain a number of active implants equal to your **Focus** modifier (min. 1). Installing a new one beyond your limit overwrites the oldest.

**5th-Level: Precision Incision**  
When you run a healing Protocol or administer an injector, you can maximize one healing die. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your **Focus** modifier (min. 1), regaining all uses on a long rest.

**9th-Level: System Reboot**  
As a reaction when a creature you can see within 30 ft. is affected by a debilitating condition (poisoned, stunned, paralyzed, blinded, or deafened), expend one 2nd-level or higher Protocol Slot to end that condition. The target also gains temporary HP equal to your **Focus** modifier + the slot’s level.

**15th-Level: Cybernetic Perfection**  
Over 1 minute, you perform masterwork surgery on a willing (or incapacitated) creature within 5 ft. You remove all diseases and conditions, restore any missing limbs or organs (fully functional), and heal hit points equal to twice your Ripperdoc level + your **Focus** modifier. Once used, this feature refreshes on a long rest.

---

## Nanite Specialist

**3rd-Level: Nanite Infusion**  
Your injectors release programmable nanites. Whenever you administer an injector or run a healing Protocol, you may add one of:
- **Wound Seal:** The recipient gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage until the end of their next turn.
- **Accelerated Metabolism:** The recipient regains HP equal to your **Focus** modifier at the start of their next turn.
- **Toxin Neutralizer:** The recipient is cured of one poison or disease.

**5th-Level: Nanite Overdrive**  
As a bonus action, spend one Protocol Slot to supercharge your nanites for 1 minute. While active, any healing you apply to yourself or others is increased by your **Focus** modifier. Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest (your choice).

**9th-Level: Swarm Protocol**  
As an action, expend a 3rd-level or higher Protocol Slot to deploy a 15-ft radius cloud of healing nanites at a point within 60 ft. Each ally in the area immediately regains 2d6 + your **Focus** modifier HP and is cured of one condition. The cloud remains for 1 minute; any ally entering it or ending their turn there gains the same benefit once.

**15th-Level: Adaptive Evolution**  
Your nanites adapt in real time. While you have at least one Protocol Slot remaining, at the start of each of your turns you and up to two allies within 30 ft. regain HP equal to your **Focus** modifier. Additionally, when you run a Protocol of 4th level or lower, you can target one extra creature at no additional slot cost.

# Cætherpunk Combat Mechanics

Below is a summary of combat rules, closely mirroring 5E SRD mechanics but reskinned for a Cætherpunk setting. Where appropriate, familiar terminology is replaced with Cætherpunk equivalents. Unless noted otherwise, all rules function identically to 5E.

---
## 1. Core Concepts

- **Vitality (HP):** Represents a character’s health and endurance. Typically tracked as a number; when reduced to 0, the character is incapacitated or “downed.”
- **Defense Rating (DR):** Replaces Armor Class. A target’s DR is what an attacker must equal or exceed on a d20 + modifiers to hit.
- **Proficiency Bonus (+P):** Unchanged from 5E; scales by character level (see 5E SRD).
- **Skill/Attribute Checks:** Whenever a rule calls for an ability check, roll d20 + relevant Ability Modifier + P (if proficient).
- **Advantage/Disadvantage:** Unchanged—roll 2d20 and take higher (advantage) or lower (disadvantage).

---

## 2. Combat Flow
### 2.1. Encounter Setup

1. **Determine Surprise:** The GM decides if any side is surprised (via Stealth vs. Perception or other circumstances). A surprised creature:
    - Cannot take actions, reactions, or movement on its first turn.
    - Regains normal function beginning on its second turn in initiative.
2. **Roll Initiative:**
    - Each combatant rolls **d20 + Agility Modifier (AGI)**.
    - Record initiative order from highest to lowest. Ties are broken by higher AGI; if still tied, roll off.
3. **Establish Positions & Cover:**
    - Map out the environment (streets, corridors, rooftops, etc.).
    - Mark cover zones (half cover, three-quarters cover, full cover).

### 2.2. Round Structure

- Combat is divided into **Rounds**. Each Round, every combatant takes one **Turn** in initiative order.

#### On Your Turn:

1. **Movement:** You can move up to your speed (feet) in any combination of directions. Moving through difficult terrain (rubble, top‐deck wiring, collapsed scaffolds) costs extra (5 ft for each 1 ft of movement).
2. **Action:** Choose one:
    - **Attack:** Make one melee or ranged weapon attack (or multiple if you have Extra Attack).
    - **Hacking Attack (if a Netrunner):** Use an Attack action to run a Hack Routine (e.g., “Overload Circuit”) against a target’s systems (see class features).
    - **Æther Channel (if able):** Cast a Canticle, Minor Script, or similar spell.
    - **Use Device:** Activate a technological gadget (grenade, stim‐injector, drone remote, etc.).
    - **Dash:** Double your movement for the turn (gain extra movement equal to your Speed).
    - **Disengage:** Your movement does not provoke Opportunity Attacks this turn.
    - **Dodge:** Until the start of your next turn, attacks against you have Disadvantage, and you gain Advantage on all Agility (AGI) saving throws.
    - **Help:** Grant Advantage on the next Attack roll by an ally against a target within 5 ft of you, or grant Advantage to an ally’s Tech or Skill check.
    - **Hide:** Make a Stealth (AGI) check. If successful, you become Hidden (advantage on your next Attack; creatures cannot see you unless they succeed on a Perception check).
    - **Search:** Make an Investigation (LOG) or Perception (FOC) check to locate hidden enemies, traps, or secret panels.
    - **Use Object:** Interact with an object that requires more than a free interaction (e.g., pry open a locked door, recharge a gadget, swap cyber‐mod attachments).
3. **Bonus Action (if available):** Certain features (e.g., some class features) allow a second, smaller action.
4. **Reaction (on other turns):** You can take one Reaction per Round when its trigger occurs (e.g., opportunity attack).

### 2.3. Opportunity Attacks

- Provoked when a hostile creature you can see moves out of your melee range without Disengaging.
- Use your Reaction to make one melee Attack vs. their DR.

---

## 3. Attack Rolls & Defense Rating
### 3.1. Making an Attack

- **Roll:** d20 + Ability Modifier + Proficiency Bonus (if proficient with weapon).
    - **Melee Weapons:** Use Might (MGT) Modifier unless the weapon has the Finesse property—in which case, you may use Agility (AGI).
    - **Ranged Weapons:** Use Agility (AGI) Modifier.
    - **Tech Weapons (e.g., smartguns, energy rifles):** Usually use Agility (AGI), but some specialized weapons (heavy railguns, power fists) use Might (MGT). If a weapon has the “Cybertech” tag, apply relevant Tech Use (LOG/MGT) to modify accuracy—DM may require a Tech Use check for particularly complex exploits (e.g., auto‐targeting pulse cannons).
    - **Ætheric Attacks (Canticles):** Use the spellcasting Ability Modifier, plus Proficiency if the caster’s class grants it.
    - **Hacking Attacks:** Netrunners roll d20 + Logic (LOG) Modifier + Proficiency Bonus (if proficient in Hacking); compare to target’s **System Firewall Rating** (analogous to DR).
- **Hit if:** Attack roll ≥ target’s Defense Rating (DR).

### 3.2. Defense Rating (DR)

- **Base DR:** 10 + Agility (AGI) Modifier.
- **Armor/Armor Modules:** Armor grants a flat bonus to DR. Different armor types (light, medium, heavy) add a fixed amount. Cybernetic enhancements or active defense implants can further modify DR (see §6.2).
- **Cover:** A target behind cover adds to its DR:
    - **Half Cover:** +2 DR
    - **Three-Quarters Cover:** +5 DR
    - **Full Cover:** Cannot be targeted directly by attacks; use area effects or repositioning.
- **Active Tech Defenses:** Some augmentations grant reactions (e.g., “Nano‐Shield” can give +2 DR against one incoming attack), at the GM’s discretion.

---

## 4. Damage & Healing
### 4.1. Damage Types
- **Ballistic:** Piercing/slashing energy from kinetic weapons (e.g., firearms, smartguns).
- **Energy:** Laser, plasma, electric shocks from energy weapons or Ætheric blasts.
- **Melee:** Physical cuts, bashes, or slams (blades, cyber‐fists).
- **Psychic:** Psionic or Ætheric mental assault, often from Aberrant Mind or Psychic Blasts.
- **Necrotic/Poison:** From viral plagues, bio‐chemical agents, or undead‐style Ætheric drain.
- **Radiant:** Divine or EMP‐like bursts, often from Lawbringer/Paladin auras or high‐end tech bursts that “purify” circuits.
- 
### 4.2. Applying Damage

1. **Roll damage dice** as indicated by weapon, ability, or spell.
2. **Add Damage Modifiers** (e.g., Might for melee, Agility for ranged, Ability Mod for specific features).
3. **Subtract any Resistance**: Some armor, cyber‐implants, or class features grant resistance to specific damage types (take half damage).
4. **Subtract total from Vitality (HP)**. If HP ≤ 0, the character falls unconscious and begins making death (or “Shutdown”) saving throws.

### 4.3. Healing and Recovery
- **Medtech Kits (First Aid):** As an Action, expend a Medtech Kit to restore 1d8 + LOG (Medtech) HP.
- **Nano‐Symbiotes:** As a Bonus Action, a Biohacker can expend a limited resource (nano swarm) to restore HP equal to 1d6 + END.
- **Ætheric Healing (Lay on Hands / Canticle of Restoration):** Works identically to 5E Lay on Hands or Cure Wounds, but called “Nano‐Canticle” or “Protocol: Heal.” Scale by class level.
- **Short Rest (Recharge):** After 1–10 minutes of downtime, a character can spend Hit Dice (HD) to regain HP (roll HD, add CON (END) modifier). Classes regain class‐specific resources (e.g., Hack Points, Sorcery Points) on a Short Rest.
- **Long Rest:** After ~8 hours of sleep or meditation, restore all HP, replenish spell slots/Æther Slots, Hack Points/battery, and daily class features.

---

## 5. Weapons & Armor
### 5.1. Weapon Categories

Weapons have these attributes:
- **Damage:** Listed as dice + relevant Ability Modifier.
- **Range:** Melee weapons have a “reach” (typically 5 ft). Ranged/Tech weapons have a normal range and long range (beyond normal but with Disadvantage).
- **Properties:** Finesse, Light, Heavy, Two‐handed, Thrown, Reload (magazine size), Burst (AOE), Cybertech (requires Tech Use to unlock special modes), etc.

## 6. Special Combat Options
### 6.1. Cover & Positioning

- **Half Cover (+2 DR):** Behind low walls, overturned vehicles, crates.
- **Three-Quarters Cover (+5 DR):** Behind thick concrete barriers, armored shields, large crates.
- **Full Cover (No Direct Target):** When completely behind a barrier; can only be targeted by area effects (grenades, burst fire).
- **Elevation:** Being at higher elevation grants +1 to Attack Rolls; attackers from below have Disadvantage on upward attacks beyond 10 ft.

### 6.2. Active Defense Systems
1. **Deflective Nanoshield (Reaction):** As a Reaction when hit by a melee or ranged attack, you can activate a nanite surge to gain +2 DR against that one attack. Recharge on a Short Rest.
2. **Kinetic Barrier (Reaction):** When hit by a ballistic attack, you can spend 1 Tech Use (LOG) check (DC 15) to reduce damage by half.
3. **EMP Pulse (Action):** Emit a 5‐ft radius EMP blast; all cybernetic/tech devices within radius must succeed on a Tech Saving Throw (DC 15) or be disabled for 1 turn. One use per Short Rest.

### 6.3. Hacking in Combat (Netrunner)
- **Hack Point (HPt) Pool:** Netrunners use HPt in place of Æther Slots. HPt regenerate on Short Rest or via battery packs.
- **Hack Routines (Exploits):** Functions like spells. Each has a level (1–5) and costs HPt equal to the level. You must have the exploit “loaded” in your Cyberdeck (Neural Interface).
    - **Load Exploit (Prep):** As part of a Short Rest, load a number of Exploits into your Neural Interface equal to your LOG+P (max list known).
- **Hack Actions:**
    1. **System Intrusion (Attack Action):** Make a Hacking Attack roll (d20 + LOG Mod + P) vs. target’s **Firewall Rating (FR)** (usually equal to DR or specialized for cyber‐targets). On hit, you inflict “System Shock”—target is Stunned or their Tech‐dependent weapons shut down for 1 turn.
    2. **Overload Circuit (Attack Action):** Cost: 1 HPt. Target must make a Tech Saving Throw (DC 8 + LOG Mod + P). On fail, target takes 2d6 + LOG Energy damage, and their DR is reduced by 2 for 1 turn.
    3. **Data Spike (Bonus Action):** Cost: 1 HPt. Make a Hacking Attack vs. FR. On hit, deal 1d4 Psychic damage and mark target; marked targets take +2 to all Attack Rolls and Ability Checks made by you until end of your next turn.
    4. **Firewall Ghost (Reaction):** When an enemy attempts to hack or EMP you, roll d20 + LOG Mod + P. On a tie or higher vs. their hacking roll, you deflect or absorb the effect. Once used per Round.
- **Countermeasures & Defenses:**
    - **Encryption Layer (Reaction):** Spend 1 HPt when targeted by a Hack Attack; impose Disadvantage on their roll.
    - **Dump Data (Action):** If your Neural Interface is compromised, as an Action, wipe your active cache—automatically end all ongoing hacks on you; can only be used once per Short Rest.

## 7. Conditions & Status Effects
All standard 5E conditions apply, but with Cætherpunk flavor:

| Condition         | Effect / Flavor                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Blinded**       | Can’t see; Attack Rolls against you have Advantage; your Attacks have Disadvantage. “Your visual implants flicker off.”                                          |
| **Charmed**       | Cannot attack charmer; charmer has Advantage on social checks vs. you. “Your neural pathways misfire in the presence of that persona.”                           |
| **Deafened**      | Can’t hear; automatically fail Auditory Perception. “Your audio implants are scrambled.”                                                                         |
| **Frightened**    | Disadvantage on Ability Checks and Attack Rolls while you “see” threat; can’t move closer if able. “Your fear circuits overload.”                                |
| **Grappled**      | Speed becomes 0; can’t benefit from bonuses to speed. “Mag‐tethers or cyber‐clamps hold you.”                                                                    |
| **Incapacitated** | Can’t take Actions or Reactions; can’t move. “Systems are offline or overwhelmed.”                                                                               |
| **Paralyzed**     | Incapacitated, Speed = 0, automatically fail STR/DEX Saves; Attacks against you are critical hits if within 5 ft. “Neural locks shut down your motor functions.” |
| **Poisoned**      | Disadvantage on Attack Rolls and Ability Checks. “Bio‐toxin in your bloodstream.”                                                                                |
| **Prone**         | Only beneficial Attack Rolls with Advantage from within 5 ft; movement costs to stand up. “You’re on the ground; your servomotors must restart.”                 |
| **Restrained**    | Speed = 0, Disadvantage on STR/DEX Checks & Saves; Attack Rolls vs. you have Advantage. “Your cyber‐joints are locked.”                                          |
| **Stunned**       | Incapacitated, can’t move/speak, Rolls automatically fail, Attacks vs. you have Advantage. “Circuit overload freezes your system.”                               |
| **Unconscious**   | Incapacitated, can’t move/speak, rolls fail STR/DEX Saves, Attacks vs. you are critical hits if attacker within 5 ft. “Your vitals are at zero.”                 |

## 8. Difficulty Checks & Skills in Combat
- **Skill Challenges (DC 10–30):** Use when bypassing security doors, hacking terminals under fire, or performing advanced weapon techniques.
- **Covering Fire (Team Tactics):** One ally can use Help to grant Advantage on Attack Rolls vs. target if they occupy adjacent, flanking positions.
- **Suppressive Fire:** As an Attack Action with a rapid‐fire weapon (SMG, Assault Rifle), you can lay down suppressive rounds into a 20 ft cone. All enemies in the cone must succeed on a DEX (AGI) Save (DC 8 + P + AGI Mod) or drop Prone and have their movement cut in half until end of their next turn.
- **Overwatch (Reaction):** As a Bonus Action, enter Overwatch mode. Until the start of your next turn, if a hostile creature enters your weapon’s normal range and you have LoS, you can use your Reaction to make a single attack.

## 9. Optional/Advanced Rules

- **Burst Fire Suppression:** See §5.1 for mechanics.
- **Hacking Overwatch:** Netrunners in Cover can set a firewall Overwatch: Reaction to attempt to jam any enemy drone entering their line of sight.
- **Aerial Combat:** If flying (drone, jetpack, Ætheric Flight), treat vertical movement separately; movement uses a single pool (e.g., 30 ft of flying). Attacks from above grant +1 to hit; target has Disadvantage if also flying and higher altitude.
- **Critical Fail/System Crash:** On a natural 1 in a hacking check, the Netrunner’s Neural Interface glitches—unable to run further hacks for 1 turn and take 1d4 Psychic damage.
- **Environmental Hazards:** Electrified floors, radiation zones, zero‐gravity—treat as Dangerous Terrain (costs double movement) and/or forcing periodic Saving Throws (AGI or lose balance, prone, or take damage).

### Summary

Cætherpunk combat follows the familiar 5E framework—d20 Attack rolls vs. Defense Rating, Vitality for HP, and standard Action/Bonus Action/Reaction economy—while swapping swords for smartguns, spells for Hacks and Canticles, and armor for nano‐armor or powered exoskeletons. This reskin retains 5E’s balance and flow while immersing characters in a high‐tech, Æther‐infused urban battlefield.
