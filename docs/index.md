## 1. Introduction & Setting Primer

Welcome to the world of **CÆTHERPUNK 5E**—where neon, chrome, digital gods, and mind-bending powers shape reality in a city that never sleeps.

In this game, you are an **Operator**: a renegade Netrunner, psychic outcast, chrome-plated samurai, nano-witch, info broker, or whatever archetype you imagine. Technology and magic have fused—whether through biohacking, code, psychic force, or pure will. **Æther** is the new "magic," and _programs_ are as deadly as any spell.

### Core Themes

- **Æther:** The invisible force channeling psychic/biotic effects.
- **Programs:** Digital powers, AR hacks, and netrunners’ arsenal.
- **Nano:** Tiny machines for healing, sabotage, miracles.
- **Chrome:** Cybernetic upgrades and physical rewiring.
- **The Grid:** AR, VR, citywide surveillance, and the “ghost layer.”
- **The Street:** Underworld, resistance, gangs, syndicates.

## **Channelers of the Current and Divine Code**

Whether they serve machine gods, the Current, aetheric traditions, or corporate deities, they wield awe-inspiring abilities. Some are healers, others are battle-chaplains or tech exorcists. In a world where belief and code blur, their “miracles” might be aetheric rituals, cutting-edge biotech, or networked prayers broadcast from neon-lit cathedrals.

---

## **Creating a Aetherites

Where does your power come from—a machine deity, the city’s hidden Aether, an ancient aether cult, or a megacorp’s divine grid? What is your creed or protocol? Do you bring hope, justice, control, or disruption to your flock? Are you a true believer, or a master manipulator of symbols and code?

Whether they serve machine gods, the Current, aetheric traditions, or corporate deities, they wield awe-inspiring abilities. Some are healers, others are battle-chaplains or tech exorcists. In a world where belief and code blur, their “miracles” might be aetheric rituals, cutting-edge biotech, or networked prayers broadcast from neon-lit cathedrals.

---

## **Creating a Aetherites

Where does your power come from—a machine deity, the city’s hidden Aether, an ancient aether cult, or a megacorp’s divine grid? What is your creed or protocol? Do you bring hope, justice, control, or disruption to your flock? Are you a true believer, or a master manipulator of symbols and code?

- **Ritual Coder:** You can cast any program marked as a ritual from the Artificer list as a ritual, even if you don’t have it prepared.

### **3rd Level: Aetheric Disruption**

- When a creature you can see within 30 ft casts a spell or uses a tech ability, you can use your reaction and a program slot to attempt to disrupt it (forcing a Logic saving throw vs your program save DC or the effect fails).

### **6th Level: Gridwalk**

- **Aetheric Walk:** As a bonus action, you can phase into the city’s Current or local network, allowing you to teleport up to 30 ft to a spot you can see, provided both spaces are within digital or aetheric “infrastructure” (such as a city block, server farm, subway station, etc.). You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Logic modifier (minimum 1) per long rest.

### **14th Level: Firewall Master**

- **Personal Firewall:** You have advantage on all saving throws against spells, programs, and tech effects.

## Biohacker


**Role:** Shapeshifter, nano-witch, biotech healer, city mage

**You are...**

- A conduit for living magic: nanites, viruses, symbiotes, and the pulse of the city.
- Able to heal, morph, or unleash biotech miracles on friend and foe alike.
- Deeply attuned to the “living” spirit of the urban wild—its creatures, drones, and emergent nature.
- The team’s answer to wounds, plagues, and biological warfare.

---
## **Masters of Urban Life, Nanotech, and Aetheric Nature**

Biohackers are street scientists, urban shamans, and nano-mancers who bend the city’s living systems to their will. Some are gene-hackers or rogue biotech engineers, others blend ancient traditions with aetheric science. They manipulate both the wild currents of the city’s ecology and the hidden aether that binds life together—splicing, morphing, and healing with nanites or bio-tech. Whether in a neon-lit jungle or a rooftop garden, a biohacker is always attuned to the pulse of urban nature.

---

## **Creating a Biohacker**

Where did you learn to bend life? Were you a corporate biologist gone rogue, a member of an eco-hacker collective, or a spiritualist who communes with the city’s spirits and data ghosts? What is your connection to the living city—science, magic, or something stranger?

## Chrome Ronin

## Biohacker Subclass: Mutagenist

**Role:** Mutation artist, survivalist, body horror specialist

**You are...**

- A living engine of change—constantly mutating to meet urban threats.
- Able to sprout claws, gills, wings, or even chitinous armor at will.
- A master of adaptability: no environment or hazard can catch you off guard.

---

#### 3rd Level: Adaptive Mutation, Bio-Twist

- **Adaptive Mutation:** As a bonus action, you can grant yourself one of the following until your next short rest: climbing speed, swim speed, darkvision, or resistance to one damage type. You may have a number of mutations active at once equal to your FOC modifier (min 1).
- **Bio-Twist:** You can “twist” your biology to survive, gaining advantage on saving throws against poison, disease, and exhaustion. You can extend this benefit to one ally once per long rest.

#### 6th Level: Mutagenic Fortitude

- Gain temporary hit points equal to your Biohacker level + FOC modifier at the start of every combat. These last until depleted or the combat ends.

#### 10th Level: Crisis Metamorph

- As a reaction to taking damage, instantly morph for resistance to that damage type until the start of your next turn. You may do this a number of times equal to your FOC modifier (min 1) per long rest.

#### 14th Level: Hyper-Adaptive Evolution

- Your transformations become instantaneous and unlimited in duration. You may now “stack” two different damage resistances, and you are immune to exhaustion and disease.

## Street Samurai

**Role:** Urban warrior, corporate enforcer, professional soldier

## **Masters of Combat and Urban War**

Street Samurai are the city’s elite enforcers, mercenaries, gunfighters, and blade-dancers. They are bodyguards for corporate execs, vigilantes with a code, bounty hunters, or professional soldiers. Whether wielding mono-edge katanas, heavy rail pistols, or cyber-augmented fists, the Street Samurai is a weapon made flesh—refined by discipline, tech, and streetwise grit.

---

## **Creating a Street Samurai**

What forged your discipline—military training, syndicate service, a dojo on a rooftop, or survival in the city’s underbelly? What is your weapon of choice: ancient steel, bleeding-edge ballistics, or your own nanite-augmented fists? Do you fight for a cause, for a paycheck, or just for survival?

Digital Programs and Routines are the signature tools of netrunners, aetherites, hackers, AI cultists, and operators who can bend the urban network to their will. Whether called scripts, exploits, system hacks, or AR overlays, routines allow users to:

- Interface with tech, drones, networks, and AI
- Override security, sensors, weapons, and communications
- Heal, harm, or support allies and machines in the digital or hybrid space

Routines may be run via cyberdecks, custom chips, voice command, or direct neural interface. Each program has a level, routine type, a short description, and classes/subclasses with access.
