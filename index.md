# CAETHERPUNK

Welcome to the world of **CÆTHERPUNK 5E**—where neon, chrome, digital gods, and mind-bending powers shape reality in a city that never sleeps.

In this game, you are an **Operator**: a renegade [[Netrunner]], psychic outcast, chrome-plated samurai, nano-witch, info broker, or whatever archetype you imagine. Technology and magic have fused—whether through biohacking, code, psychic force, or pure will. **Æther** is the new "magic," and _programs_ are as deadly as any spell.

### Core Themes

- **Æther:** The invisible force channeling psychic/biotic effects.
- **Programs:** Digital powers, AR hacks, and netrunners’ arsenal.
- **Nano:** Tiny machines for healing, sabotage, miracles.
- **Chrome:** Cybernetic upgrades and physical rewiring.
- **The Grid:** AR, VR, citywide surveillance, and the “ghost layer.”
- **The Street:** Underworld, resistance, gangs, syndicates.
